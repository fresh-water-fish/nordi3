[url-handlers]
# Allows setting the commands to run for various URL schemes.
# E.g. to open FTP URLs with FileZilla set the following key:
#   ftp = 'filezilla'
# You can set any scheme to "off" or "" to disable handling it, or
# just leave the key unset.
#
# DO NOT use this for setting the HTTP command.
# Use the http setting in the "a-general" section above.
#
# NOTE: These settings are overrided by the ones in the proxies section.
# Note the use of single quotes, so that backslashes will not be escaped.

# This is a special key that defines the handler for all URL schemes for which
# no handler is defined.
other = 'off'


# [[mediatype-handlers]] section
# ---------------------------------
#
# Specify what applications will open certain media types.
# By default your default application will be used to open the file when you select "Open".
# You only need to configure this section if you want to override your default application,
# or do special things like streaming.
#
# Note the use of single quotes for commands, so that backslashes will not be escaped.
#
#
# To open jpeg files with the feh command:
#
# [[mediatype-handlers]]
# cmd = ['feh']
# types = ["image/jpeg"]
#
# Each command that you specify must come under its own [[mediatype-handlers]]. You may
# specify as many [[mediatype-handlers]] as you want to setup multiple commands.
#
# If the subtype is omitted then the specified command will be used for the
# entire type:
#
# [[mediatype-handlers]]
# command = ['vlc', '--flag']
# types = ["audio", "video"]
#
# A catch-all handler can by specified with "*".
# Note that there are already catch-all handlers in place for all OSes,
# that open the file using your default application. This is only if you
# want to override that.
#
# [[mediatype-handlers]]
# cmd = ['some-command']
# types = [
#         "application/pdf",
#         "*",
# ]
#
# You can also choose to stream the data instead of downloading it all before
# opening it. This is especially useful for large video or audio files, as
# well as radio streams, which will never complete. You can do this like so:
#
# [[mediatype-handlers]]
# cmd = ['vlc', '-']
# types = ["audio", "video"]
# stream = true
#
# This uses vlc to stream all video and audio content.
# By default stream is set to off for all handlers
#
#
# If you want to always open a type in its viewer without the download or open
# prompt appearing, you can add no_prompt = true
#
# [[mediatype-handlers]]
# cmd = ['feh']
# types = ["image"]
# no_prompt = true
#
# Note: Multiple handlers cannot be defined for the same full media type, but
# still there needs to be an order for which handlers are used. The following
# order applies regardless of the order written in the config:
#
# 1. Full media type: "image/jpeg"
# 2. Just type: "image"
# 3. Catch-all: "*"

# How long a page will stay in cache, in seconds.
timeout = 1800 # 30 mins

[proxies]
# Allows setting a Gemini proxy for different schemes.
# The settings are similar to the url-handlers section above.
# E.g. to open a gopher page by connecting to a Gemini proxy server:
#   gopher = "example.com:123"
#
# Port 1965 is assumed if no port is specified.
#
# NOTE: These settings override any external handlers specified in
# the url-handlers section.
#
# Note that HTTP and HTTPS are treated as separate protocols here.


[subscriptions]
# For tracking feeds and pages

# Whether a pop-up appears when viewing a potential feed

# How often to check for updates to subscriptions in the background, in seconds.
# Set it to 0 to disable this feature. You can still update individual feeds
# manually, or restart the browser.
#
# Note Amfora will check for updates on browser start no matter what this setting is.
update_interval = 1800 # 30 mins

# How many subscriptions can be checked at the same time when updating.
# If you have many subscriptions you may want to increase this for faster
# update times. Any value below 1 will be corrected to 1.
